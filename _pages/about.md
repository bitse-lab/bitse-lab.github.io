Hi! I am currently an assistant professor at school of computer science & technology, Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT). I got my Ph.D degree in July 2020 from School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), Peking University, China. I was very fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. Zhi Jin and Prof. Minghui Zhou. My research interest mainly focuses on improving the quality and efficiency of software engineering through the application of  big data mining, deep learning, statistic analysis, etc. Recently, my studies are focused on improving the sustainability of open-source software, since open source software has almost changed the world!

I'm looking for students who are interested in software engineering, open source software, or data mining. Please contact me by Email: yuxiazh[AT]bit[DOT]edu[DOT]cn
